	Mouse Position Tracker

	Track your mouse's x and y position within an element.
	As you move the mouse within the element, the x position
	and y position values will update.

		1. Create a page element and add sizing to it, including height
		   and width. Create a class style named active that has a
		   background-color property of red. Finally, create an output element
		   that will contain your text.

		2. Select the main container element and add event listeners to it.
		   Listen for mouseover, mouseout, and mousemove.

		3. On mouseover, add the active class, and on mouseout,
		   remove the active class.

		4. On mousemove, call a function that tracks the event element clientX
		   and clientY positions, embeds them in a human-readable sentence,
		   and outputs it into the output element.
